Different Models of Neurons (MCP, Hebb, Perceptron)

For the MCP model, the weights and the threshold are taken as inputs so as to check for the correctness of the combination suiting for the gate.

Hebb and Perceptron model each have an extra input as the bias that is tied to one.

For the Hebbian and Perceptron Learning models, the progression of learning happens on the basis of the formulae specified for the pre-defined models. Perceptron offers a higher degree of control by providing the choice of changing the learning rate for the model.

The TC classifier under Hebb and Perceptron is a proof of concept that these basical neural models can easily distinguish between two characters represented over an NxM matrix which is represented as an array.
